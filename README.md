# Acelerometer
 
Repository for the quinematic tracking project.
It contains two main programs, the server that is housed on an esp8266 development board with a mcu6050 accelerometer.
The second program corresponds to a python class that connects as a client to the development card. This class seeks to simplify the escalation process for multiple servers.
